## Added scaffolded modules (10 pages)
Added pages under `src/pages/`:
- AuthModule, PreferencesModule, BudgetModule, TransportModule, AccommodationModule, ActivitiesModule, ItineraryGenerator, MapRouteOptimizer, ItineraryOutput, AdminPanel

Navigation updated to include routes to these pages.

## Images
Placeholder SVGs added to `public/assets/tamilnadu/`. Replace with real photos of Tamil Nadu tourist places.

## Maps & APIs
- Scaffolded `src/components/LeafletMap.tsx`. To enable:
  1. `npm install leaflet react-leaflet`
  2. Add `import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';` in `src/main.tsx` or `index.css`.
  3. Use Amadeus APIs (hotels, transport) from a secure server-side component â€” keep API keys secret.

## How to continue
- Install additional deps: `npm i react-leaflet leaflet @types/leaflet`
- Implement server endpoints to proxy Amadeus requests and secure API keys.
- Replace placeholder images with real photographs (filenames present in public/assets/tamilnadu).
